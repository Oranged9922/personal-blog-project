The Static Blog Webpage Generator is a tool written in Haskell that allows you to parse markdown files and create a static blog webpage using HTML templates. This tool simplifies the process of generating static webpages from markdown content.

## Features
- Parse Markdown Files: The generator can parse markdown files and extract the content to be used in the generated webpages.
- HTML Templates: You can define HTML templates to structure the layout and design of your blog webpages.
- Customization: The generator provides options for customizing the appearance and behavior of the generated webpages.
- Metadata Extraction: Extract metadata from markdown files to provide additional information for webpage generation (e.g., title, author, date).

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To build and run the Static Webpage Generator, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

* **[GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler)](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/)**
* **[Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/)**

### Installation
1. Clone the repository: ``git clone https://github.com/Oranged9922/personal-blog-project.git``
2. Navigate to the project directory: ``cd personal-blog-project``
3. **TODO**
## Usage
-  **TODO**
### Configuration

## Functional Requirements
1. **Parsing Markdown Files**: The generator should be able to parse markdown files and extract the content to be used in the generated webpages.
2. **HTML Template Support**: Users should be able to define HTML templates to structure the layout and design of their blog webpages.
3. **Customization Options**: The generator should provide options for customizing the appearance and behavior of the generated webpages, such as defining CSS styles or adding custom JavaScript code.
4. **Metadata Extraction**: The generator should be able to extract metadata from markdown files, such as title, author, and date, to provide additional information for webpage generation.
5. **Output Generation**: The generator should generate static HTML webpages based on the parsed markdown content and HTML templates, saving them to the specified output directory.

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: The generator should be efficient and able to handle a large number of markdown files without significant slowdowns.
2. **Usability**: The tool should be easy to use, with clear instructions and a simple command-line interface.
3. **Error Handling**: The generator should handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to help users troubleshoot issues.
4. **Portability**: The tool should be compatible with different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) and should not have any dependencies that limit its usage on specific platforms.
5. **Maintainability**: The code should be well-organized, modular, and follow best practices to ensure ease of maintenance and future enhancements.
6. **Extensibility**: The tool should be designed in a way that allows for easy extension or modification in the future to support additional features or formats.

## Constraints
* **Haskell Programming Language**: The generator should be implemented in Haskell, utilizing its features and libraries to accomplish the required functionality.
* **Markdown Standard**: The generator should adhere to the standard Markdown syntax and support common Markdown elements and extensions.
* **HTML Compatibility**: The generated webpages should be compatible with modern web browsers and adhere to HTML standards.
